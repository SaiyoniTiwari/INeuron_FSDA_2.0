2. Write down the various applications of Excel in the industry.


Ans) Applications of MS Excel:-

Data Entry and Storage: MS Excel is a powerful tool for data entry and storage. It is important to organize data in columns and rows, use proper formatting and naming conventions, and use features such as data validation to ensure accuracy. Generally, excel worksheets can have 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns in a table form. Once the table is created, we can perform various tasks and analyses on it using multiple tools and formulae

Performing Calculations: MS Excel is a powerful tool for performing calculations. To perform calculations, enter the formula in a cell using appropriate mathematical operators such as +, -, *, /, ^ for exponentiation. It is important to use proper cell references and check for formula errors. Excel also has built-in functions that can be used for more complex calculations, such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and MIN.

Data Analysis and Interpretation: Data analysis and interpretation using Microsoft Excel involve using various tools and functions within the program to analyze and make sense of numerical data. This can include using functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT to perform calculations and tools like charts and pivot tables to visualize and summarize data. Using Excel's features effectively lets you gain insights into your data and make informed decisions based on the results.

Reporting and Visualizations: Reporting and visualizations in Microsoft Excel involve using features such as charts, tables, and graphs to organize data. This can include creating pivot tables and pivot charts to summarize large amounts of data, using conditional formatting to highlight important information, and creating interactive` dashboards to display key metrics. By utilizing Excel's reporting and visualization tools, you can effectively communicate insights and findings to stakeholders in a compelling and easily understandable way.

Forecasting: orecasting using Microsoft Excel involves using various tools and functions within the program to predict future trends based on historical data. This can include using functions such as TREND, FORECAST, and GROWTH to generate forecasts and create charts and graphs to visualize the forecasted data.

Additionally, when there is no past data, but we have the target, excel can be essential in finding the correct inputs for the specific results. This can be done using the feature Goal Seek Analysis. By properly feeding the right target objective, one can identify what can be done to achieve the set target.


3. On the ribbon, make a new tab. Add some different groups, insert commands in the groups and name them according to their commands added. Copy and paste the screenshot of the steps you followed.

Ans) To make your favorite commands easily accessible, you can add your own tab to the Excel ribbon. Here's how:

1) In the Customize the Ribbon window, under the list of tabs, click the New Tab button.
This adds a custom tab with a custom group because commands can only be added to custom groups.

2) Select the newly created tab, named New Tab (Custom), and click the Renameâ€¦ button to give your tab an appropriate name. In the same manner, change the default name given by Excel to a custom group. For the detailed guidelines, please see how to rename ribbon items.

3) When done, click OK to save the changes. custom tab is added to the Excel ribbon immediately, though the custom group is not displayed because it is empty. For the group to show up, it must contain at least one command. We will add commands to our custom tab in a moment but, to be consistent, we will first look at how to create a custom group.


4. Make a list of different shortcut keys that are only connected to
formatting with their functions.

Ans) Here are my top five Excel formatting shortcuts:

CONTROL + B: Applies bold font formatting to headers
ALT + H + B + A: Applies borders to the cells
ALT + H + B + T: Gives an outline border to the dataset
ALT + H + O + W: Autofits column widths
CONTROL + 1: Opens Format Cells dialog box


5. What distinguishes Excel from other analytical tools?

Ans) MS Excel and data analysis tools like R Studio, Power BI, and Tableau are all tools used for data analysis, but there are some differences between them:

Functionality: MS Excel is a spreadsheet program that can handle basic data analysis tasks such as sorting, filtering, and creating basic charts and graphs. However, data analysis tools like R Studio, Power BI, and Tableau are designed specifically for data analysis and offer more advanced functionality such as statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

Data Handling: Excel is limited in terms of the amount of data it can handle, whereas data analysis tools like R Studio, Power BI, and Tableau can handle much larger datasets. These tools are also more efficient at handling different data formats and sources.

Programming: Excel has a basic programming language (VBA) that allows users to automate certain tasks. However, data analysis tools like R Studio are designed for programming and offer much more advanced programming capabilities. Users can write code to perform complex data analysis tasks, including statistical modeling and machine learning.

Data Visualization: Excel provides basic data visualization capabilities, but data analysis tools like Power BI and Tableau are designed specifically for creating visualizations. These tools offer more advanced visualization options, such as interactive dashboards, that are not available in Excel.

Cost: Excel is generally included in Microsoft Office packages, while data analysis tools like R Studio, Power BI, and Tableau require a separate license and can be more expensive.

In summary, MS Excel is a general-purpose spreadsheet program that can handle basic data analysis tasks, while data analysis tools like R Studio, Power BI, and Tableau are designed specifically for data analysis and offer more advanced functionality, including data visualization, programming capabilities, and handling larger datasets.


6. Create a table and add a custom header and footer to your table.

Ans) Insert a header or footer:-

1) Go to Insert > Header or Footer.

2) Choose the header style you want to use.

3) Add or change text for the header or footer. For more info on things you can do with headers, see Edit your existing headers and footers. To edit a header or footer that's been already created, double-click on it.

4) To eliminate a header--like deleting it on the title page--select it and then check the Different First Page box. 

5) Select Close Header and Footer or press Esc to exit.
